    "Before we go any further, you should know the basics of four key concepts, assumptions about which having significant consequences to whether or not certain statistical methods are appropriate to apply. The book [Multivariate Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Multivariate-Data-Analysis-Joseph-Hair/dp/9332536503) by Hair et al. introduces them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Normality</b> - When we talk about normality, we mean that the data should follow a normal, Gaussian distribution: the characteristic \"bell curve.\" Many statistical analyses (e.g. t-tests, ANOVA, simple regression) assume a normal distribution, so in case the data follows a different one, they must be transformed, or analysed with methods appropriate for the observed distribution.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Homoscedasticity</b> - Homoscedasticity refers to the 'assumption that dependent variable(s) exhibit equal levels of variance across the range of predictor variable(s)' [(Hair et al., 2013)](https://www.amazon.com/Multivariate-Data-Analysis-Joseph-Hair/dp/9332536503). In other words, the variance (and standard deviation) should be equivalent across your features. If this is not the case (i.e. the data is <i>hetero</i>scedastic), mathematical and computational treatment of the data becomes much trickier. Failing to notice your data is heteroscedastic can cause you to overestimate the <i>goodness of fit</i> of a model, e.g. Pearson's correlation coefficient.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Linearity</b> - A common way to assess linearity is to examine scatter plots and search for linear patterns visually. If patterns are not linear, it is worth considering data transformation, or non-parametric testing. The scatter plots we've seen thusfar appear to have mostly linear relationships, so we'll not pay it further attention.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Absence of correlated errors</b> - Linear regression models, along with many other statistical methods, explicitly assume that errors are independent. Correlated errors, like the name suggests, break this assumption. Autocorrelation most often occurs in time series data, but should not be an issue here.<br><br>\n",
